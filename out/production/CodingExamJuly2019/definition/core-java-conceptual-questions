What is difference between path and classpath variables?
a bath is an environment variable which is used by the operating system to find
the executables.
Classpath is an environment variable which is used by java compiler to find the path of classes
Path is nothing but setting up an environment for operating system
What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
A java interface are implicitly abstract and can not have implementation
A java abstract class can have instances methods that implements a default behavior
variable declared in a java interface is by default final. an abstract class
may contain non-final variables
Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?
No
what is Access Specifier?
a java access modifier specifies which classes can access a given class and
its fields, constructors and method.
Access modifier can be specified separetely for a class variable,method or data,member
What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
OOP, is an Object Oriented programing,there are three major features in OOP,
that makes them different than non-oop languages,Encapsulation,Inheritances,and polymorphism
Encapsulation, is used to hide the data,
Inheritance is mechanism in java by which one class can inherit the
features fields,methods of another class
polymorphism is ability of an object to have many forms

What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?
a package is a group of similar types of classes
packages imported by default are Package with no name,Java.lang package,the current package
What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
API is a collection of pre written packages ,classes,and interfaces,
with their respective methods,fields and constructors
Does java support multiple inheritance, explain why or why not?
Java can support multiple inheritances but not using class,it can be supported
using interfaces
What is method overloading and when it happens?
overloading is the ability to define more than one method and it happens in
compile time
Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
try to run your code and catch to handle it
What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
static is member of class that isn't associated with an instances of class
static variables are shared among all instances of class
What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
Final is non-access modifier applicable only to a variable ,a method or class
when a variable is declared with final keyword it's value can't be changed
What is final, finally and finalize?
final class can't be inherited ,final method can't be overridden and final variable value
cant be changed.
finally is used to place important code it will be executed whether exception is handled
or not,Finalize is used to perform clean up processing just before object is garbage collected
What is a constructor ?
is block of code that initializes the newly created object,Constructor has the same name
as the Class
Can we have multiple constructors in a class?
A class can have multiple constructors as long as thier signature are not the same
If we don't have a constructor declared, what is called during the object creation?
default Constructor
What is "this" keyword in java ?
"This" is a reference variable tha refers current object,it can be used to refer instances
variable of a current class it can be used to invoke or initiate current class constructor
What is "super" keyword in java? How many possible way can you use?
Super refers to superclass (parent) object it is used to access the superclass and
sub-class method definition,Only public and protected methods can be
 called by the super keyword


What is JVM stand for ?
Java virtual Machine
Is JVM platform independent?
means once compiled you can execute the program on any platform
What version of java are you using?
Java SE 8
What is JAR stand for ?
Java ARchive
What is the difference between JDK and JVM?
JDK is for development and JVM is the heart of java and provides platform independence
What is the difference between JVM and JRE?
What is compile time and run time?
Compile time is the instances where the code you entered is converted to executable
Run-time is the instance where the executable is running
What is heap?
Heap is the Run-time data area from which memory for all class instances
and arrays is allocated
How java manage it's memory?
JVM manages the memory this includes allocating memory from OS, allocation include heap
compaction and removal of garbage object and finally provides the run-time environment
What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
String is immutable where StringBUFFER and StringBuilder are mutable classes,
StringBUFFER is thread-safe whereas StringBuilder is not
What is Singleton class?
SingletonClass is a class that can have only one object,
to design SingletonClass make Constructor as a private,write a static method that has return
type object of this SingletonClass
What is Serialization and Deserialization?
is a process of converting an object into a sequence of bytes which can be persisted
to a disk or database or can be sent through stream.The reverse process of creating
object from sequence of bytes is called deserialization
when to use transient variable in java?
transient is a variable modifier used in serialization at the time of serialization
if we don't want to save value of a particular variable in file than we use transient keyword
Difference between while and do..while loop?
The do..while loop the block of code is executed at least once even though the condition
given is false,
in while-loop the condition is first tested and then the block of code is executed
if the test result is true
What is Enum?
Java ENUM is a special Java Type used to define Collection of constants,more precisely
Java ENUM can contain constants,methods
What is Iterator?
Iterator is an Interface which belongs to collection Framework, it allow us
traverse the collection access the data element and remove the data element of the collection
Which one will take more memory, an int or Integer?
Integer uses more memory than int
Why is String Immutable in Java?
String objects are cached in String pool, String are very popular as HashMap key,
it is important for them to be immutable so that they can retrieve the value object
which was stored in HashMap
What is constructor chaining in Java?
Constructor chaining is the process of calling one Constructor from another Constructor
with respect to current object, can be done in two ways , within same class using this()
keyword for constructors in same class
The difference between Serial and Parallel Garbage Collector?
Serial Collector is a default copying Collector uses only GC thread for GC Operations
Parallel Collector uses multiple GC threads for the GC Operations
What is JIT stands for?
Just-in-Time Compiler (JIT)
Explain Java Heap space and Garbage collection?
Java objects reside in the HEAP, heap is created when the JVM starts up and may increase
or decrease in size while the application runs.
when the HEAP becomes full,garbage is collected During garbage collection objects that
are no longer used are cleared thus making space for a new objects

Can you guarantee the garbage collection process?
No teh guarantee is taking by JVM based on the  eden space available in heap memory
What is the difference between stack and heap in Java?
The Stack memory is used used to store local variables and function call
HEAP memory is used to store objects in java
What is reflection in java and why is it useful?
Reflection is API that is used to examine or modify the behaviour of a methods,classes and
interfaces at run-time
what is multithreading in java?
is a process of executing multiple threads simultaneously
What is the use of synchronization in Java?
Synchronization in java guarantees that no two threads can execute a synchronized method
which requires the same lock simultaneously or concurrently
What is Framework?
Framework are large bodies usually many classes of pre written code to which you add
your own code to solve a problem in a specific domain, you make use of Framework by
calling it's method,inheritance, and supplying "callbacks", or other implementations
of the Observer pattern, Constrast to library
What are the testing Framework available in java?
JTest, The Grinder, TestNG, JUNIT, JWalk, Mockito,Powermock

They are both used for Testing but TestNG is more powerful than Junit
What are the dependencies for this project?
gson,json,

what is dependency injection in java?
is a technique whereby one object or static supplies the dependencies of another object
What is static binding and dynamic binding?
Static binding occurs during compile time While dynamic binding occurs during Run-time
